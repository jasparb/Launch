## 💰 **Fund Flow Verification**

### **When a 5 SOL Token Purchase Happens:**

```
💳 Purchase: 5 SOL
├── 3.0 SOL (60%) → Creator Funding Pool ✅
├── 1.5 SOL (30%) → DEX Liquidity Reserve ✅  
├── 0.5 SOL (10%) → Trading Pool ✅
└── 0.05 SOL (1%) → Platform Fee ✅

🎯 Tokens Received: 6,000 tokens (with 20% early bird bonus)
🗳️ Voting Power: 6,000,000 (1 token = 1 vote)
```

### **Funding Pool State After Purchase:**
- Total Collected: 3 SOL (available to creator)
- DEX Reserve: 1.5 SOL (locked for graduation)  
- Contributors: 1 (with voting power)
- Withdrawal: Requires community approval if enabled
